title: LocalGov Subteam
---

This is a subtheme of the LocalGov Base theme.

For the most part, it's just a CSS variables file to override CSS colors, fonts, spacing, etc.

If you need to, you can copy template from the base theme and place them in this theme to override them. For example if we have a template that has a row class of `.lgd-row__one-half` (two items per row) but you would like it to be `.lgd-row__one-third` (three items per row).
